  abstract = {In this paper, characteristics of PV (photovoltaic) modules under partial shading or with a damaged bypass diode in the junction box were evaluated by comparing a theoretical model and empirical data. For the electrical analysis of the current-voltage (I-V) curve of each module, a PV module with one diode cell model was proposed, and the model closely matched the empirical results. The damaged bypass diode was replaced with an element of resistance in the simulation model. The calculation shows that the open circuit voltage of the PV module with a damaged bypass diode was slightly higher than that of a PV module under shading conditions while the PV system was operating. The I-V curve of each module obtained with the solar simulator was similar to the results of the simulation. From the results of field testing each PV module, when the PV system was operating in connection with the power grid, the internal temperature of the junction box connected to the shaded PV module was 5 °C higher than that of the PV module with the damaged bypass diode. Furthermore when the PV system was not operating, the internal temperature of the junction box in the PV module with the damaged bypass diode was extremely high. This condition caused a short-circuit and the surface temperature of the damaged bypass diode reached 219 °C. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically analyzed the characteristics of a shaded PV module and a module with a damaged bypass diode.},

  abstract = {Energy scarcity in various regions worldwide not only adversely affects people's quality of life but also hinders overall development. Pakistan is among the nations grappling with energy shortages, with high consumption and limited generation, resulting in a substantial energy shortfall of 2500 MW. Floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems present an attractive solution for harnessing solar energy, particularly where land availability is constrained. These systems offer benefits such as conserving water and land while delivering higher power output compared to conventional terrestrial PV systems. While the advantages of FPV systems are generally recognized, research on their specific characteristics remains limited. This paper aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of FPV technology and its potential applications, particularly in Pakistan. By comparing ground-mounted and FPV systems, the study explores the economic, technological, and environmental implications of FPV adoption in regions with similar geographical profiles. The analysis highlights not only the cooling impact of water, which enhances the efficiency of FPV systems, but also other key aspects such as cost-effectiveness, site preparation, and environmental impact. Output power of FPV and land based obtained are 390 kW and 370 kW at irradiances of 180kW/m2and 170 kW/m2 at temperature from 30 to35°C respectively. The findings demonstrate the viability of FPV systems and emphasize that by leveraging the characteristics of water temperature, it becomes feasible to more accurately predict the electricity generation potential of FPV systems.

@article{KOONDHAR2024101449,
  abstract = {Energy scarcity in various regions worldwide not only adversely affects people's quality of life but also hinders overall development. Pakistan is among the nations grappling with energy shortages, with high consumption and limited generation, resulting in a substantial energy shortfall of 2500 MW. Floating photovoltaic (FPV) systems present an attractive solution for harnessing solar energy, particularly where land availability is constrained. These systems offer benefits such as conserving water and land while delivering higher power output compared to conventional terrestrial PV systems. While the advantages of FPV systems are generally recognized, research on their specific characteristics remains limited. This paper aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of FPV technology and its potential applications, particularly in Pakistan. By comparing ground-mounted and FPV systems, the study explores the economic, technological, and environmental implications of FPV adoption in regions with similar geographical profiles. The analysis highlights not only the cooling impact of water, which enhances the efficiency of FPV systems, but also other key aspects such as cost-effectiveness, site preparation, and environmental impact. Output power of FPV and land based obtained are 390 kW and 370 kW at irradiances of 180kW/m2and 170 kW/m2 at temperature from 30 to35°C respectively. The findings demonstrate the viability of FPV systems and emphasize that by leveraging the characteristics of water temperature, it becomes feasible to more accurately predict the electricity generation potential of FPV systems. This synthesis offers new insights and underscores the potential for FPV adoption in areas facing similar energy challenges.},

  abstract  = {Enhancement of image quality is a fundamental process for a wide range of vision-based applications. Images captured under unfavorable environments are often degraded in information content, sharpness and colorfulness. In the attempts to improve an image, the unsharp masking filter is an attractive candidate for its computational efficiency. However, the filter is vulnerable to the over-range problem where pixel magnitudes are driven beyond permissible ranges. This drawback is particularly noticeable if a non-adaptive procedure is used in the enhancement. Hence, an adaptive gain adjustment method is proposed here aiming at minimizing the number of over-range pixels while maximizing the image sharpness and information content. In this method, colorfulness is improved via color channel stretching and contrast is enhanced by edge augmentation. Specifically, a hyperbolic-tangent function, whose scale is dependent on the original image intensity and detected edges, is constructed to adjust the gain in sharpness enhancement. A collection of natural images captured under poor illumination conditions are used in the test against conventional and mask-based image enhancement approaches. Results have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms the others with regard to colorfulness, information content, and sharpness.},

  abstract = {In a typical series-connected photovoltaic module with three bypass diodes, not all of the energy generated by the individual cells in the module can be collected when one or more of the cells in the module are partially shaded. In this work, various photovoltaic (PV) module layouts are investigated, using both full-size solar cells and halved solar cells. The performance of these module layouts is investigated under conditions where one or more cells in the module are partially shaded. A solar cell equivalent circuit model has been implemented in the SPICE soft ware Micro-Cap to investigate several different module configurations. Module configurations investigated include a standard 72-cell module with 3 bypass diodes, one new configuration with a series of six matrices (whereby each matrix consists of two parallel strings of 12 halved cells each) with 3 bypass diodes, and another configuration with a series of 72 cells (whereby each matrix consists of two halved cells in parallel) with 3 bypass diodes. In the simulation, a shadow with zero transmittance was simulated to pass over the area of one 6-inch full-size solar cell in the corner of the module from two orthogonal directions, and the maximum power was calculated for each of the investigated module configurations. Simulation results show that the series-parallel hybrid connection of cells within a module has a significant improvement on the power output of the PV module under partial shading conditions.},

  abstract  = {The power output delivered from a photovoltaic module highly depends on the amount of irradiance, which reaches the solar cells. Many factors determine the ideal output or optimum yield in a photovoltaic module. However, the environment is one of the contributing parameters which directly affect the photovoltaic performance. The authors review and evaluate key contributions to the understanding, performance effects, and mitigation of power loss due to soiling on a solar panel. Electrical characteristics of PV (Voltage and current) are discussed with respect to shading due to soiling. Shading due to soiling is divided in two categories, namely, soft shading such as air pollution, and hard shading which occurs when a solid such as accumulated dust blocks the sunlight. The result shows that soft shading affects the current provided by the PV module, but the voltage remains the same. In hard shading, the performance of the PV module depends on whether some cells are shaded or all cells of the PV module are shaded. If some cells are shaded, then as long as the unshaded cells receive solar irradiance, there will be some output although there will be a decrease in the voltage output of the PV module. This study also present a few cleaning method to prevent from dust accumulation on the surface of solar arrays.},

@article{s23104918,
  abstract       = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems have immense potential to generate clean energy, and their adoption has grown significantly in recent years. A PV fault is a condition of a PV module that is unable to produce optimal power due to environmental factors, such as shading, hot spots, cracks, and other defects. The occurrence of faults in PV systems can present safety risks, shorten system lifespans, and result in waste. Therefore, this paper discusses the importance of accurately classifying faults in PV systems to maintain optimal operating efficiency, thereby increasing the financial return. Previous studies in this area have largely relied on deep learning models, such as transfer learning, with high computational requirements, which are limited by their inability to handle complex image features and unbalanced datasets. The proposed lightweight coupled UdenseNet model shows significant improvements for PV fault classification compared to previous studies, achieving an accuracy of 99.39%, 96.65%, and 95.72% for 2-class, 11-class, and 12-class output, respectively, while also demonstrating greater efficiency in terms of parameter counts, which is particularly important for real-time analysis of large-scale solar farms. Furthermore, geometric transformation and generative adversarial networks (GAN) image augmentation techniques improved the model's performance on unbalanced datasets.},

  abstract  = {The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by its number of parameters. Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges. In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks. A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora. We present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers. On large language modeling and machine translation benchmarks, these models achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art at lower computational cost.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of solar energy worldwide has attracted increasing attention due to its climatic and environmental impacts. Using MODIS data, we quantified the effects of solar farms (SFs) on albedo, vegetation (using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) as a proxy), and land surface temperature (LST) based on 116 large SFs across the world. The results show that the installation of SFs decreased the annual mean surface shortwave albedo by 0.016 ± 0.009 (mean ± 1 STD) and reduced the EVI by 0.015 ± 0.019 relative to the surrounding areas. SFs produced a strong cooling effect of −0.49 ± 0.43 K in the annual mean land surface temperature during the daytime and a weaker cooling effect of −0.21 ± 0.25 K during the nighttime. The greatest impacts on albedo and daytime LST were observed in barren land, followed by grassland and cropland, while the opposite order applied for vegetation impact. In terms of seasonal and latitudinal variations, the largest impact was observed at high latitudes in winter on albedo, at mid-latitudes in summer on vegetation, and at low latitudes in spring–summer transitions on daytime LST. Correlation analysis showed that the albedo and LST impacts were enhanced over large SFs with high capacity. The vegetation and LST impacts were both correlated with geographic and climatic factors and dependent on the type of SF (photovoltaic or concentrating solar power). Our global assessment provides observational evidence for the effects of SF construction on the environment and local climate, which can help the sustainable development of solar energy.},
